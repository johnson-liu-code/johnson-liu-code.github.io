            <h2>Sarcasm Detection &amp; Sentiment Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                This project explores how natural language processing can be used
                to recognise sarcastic intent in informal text.  By training
                neural network models on a dataset of labelled Reddit comments,
                the goal is to distinguish between sarcastic and sincere
                statements.  In future iterations the scope will expand to
                general sentiment analysis and even multimodal input (e.g.
                combining images and text).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Goal: build models that classify social‑media comments as
                    sarcastic or sincere.</li>
                <li>Current progress: preprocessing a large Kaggle dataset and
                    training feedforward, convolutional and recurrent neural
                    networks to detect sarcasm in Reddit comments.</li>
                <li>Future plans: extend the models to general sentiment
                    analysis and explore multimodal inputs that combine text
                    with images.</li>

            <h2>AI for Dominion</h2>
            <p>
                Dominion is a deck‑building card game with a complex state
                space.  This project applies reinforcement learning to train
                bots to play the game efficiently.  Key design decisions
                include whether to use a fixed or dynamic action space and how
                to structure the Q‑learning architecture for the distinct
                action and buy phases of the game.  The work is built on top
                of the open‑source <em>Pyminion</em> engine.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Goal: develop reinforcement‑learning agents that can play
                    Dominion autonomously.</li>
                <li>Current progress: experimenting with fixed versus dynamic
                    action spaces and implementing Deep Q‑Learning models to
                    learn optimal strategies.</li>
                <li>Future plans: explore curriculum learning strategies and
                    compare multi‑headed versus single‑policy networks for
                    handling the action and buy phases.</li>

            <h2>InquisitorNet – Warhammer 40K Bot</h2>
            <p>
                InquisitorNet is a prototype network of AI‑driven bots inspired
                by the Warhammer 40K universe.  Written in Python using the
                Reddit API (<code>praw</code>) and OpenAI's language models,
                each bot adopts the personality of an Imperial Inquisitor and
                engages with community posts.  The project includes modules
                for logging, encryption, scheduling and database storage,
                providing a foundation for more elaborate behaviour in later
                phases.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Goal: create a network of thematic Reddit bots that post
                    and respond as Warhammer 40K Inquisitors.</li>
                <li>Current progress: implemented character personalities,
                    memory and logging via SQLite, encryption utilities and
                    scheduling routines for posting and responding.</li>
                <li>Future plans: expand the bot network to include
                    multi‑agent coordination and integrate analysis of
                    conversations across multiple posts.</li>

            <p>
                My name is Johnson Liu.  I currently serve as a mathematics
                tutor at Diablo Valley College and am deeply interested in
                artificial intelligence and machine learning.  These projects
                represent my ongoing efforts to explore natural language
                processing, reinforcement learning and creative applications of
                AI.  I plan to continue refining these projects while
                pursuing graduate studies in this field.
